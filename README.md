# Overview

This is a program where I create a database--that includes multiple tables--to store data information.

My program includes insert statements for each table created, update and delete demonstrations, and multiple queries that retrieve data from the database.

My purpose for writing this software is to gain some experience with the step-by-step process of creating SQL Relational Databases from the ground up.
